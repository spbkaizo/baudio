## What is it?

Introducing the ultimate multitool for DIY audio enthusiasts: Baker AUDI/O Swiss Army Knife! Born from a 
mix of frustration and genius, this creation is the solution to the clutter of cables, DACs, signal 
generators, and more that used to be the bane of my experimental endeavors. Imagine a single board 
that morphs at the flick of a jumper, bending to your will and curiosity, ready to tackle a 
multitude of audio projects with elegance and ease.

Here's a glimpse into the magic woven into this board:

- **Power at Your Fingertips:** A versatile USB-to-5V pin accessible power supply, alongside a dual +5V/GND/-5V supply, ensures your projects are always juiced up.
- **Pristine Audio Quality:** The onboard USB DAC interface connects directly to a PCM2706, offering crystal-clear digital-to-analog conversion.
- **Expand Your Audio Universe:** With an i2S breakout for daisy-chaining DACs (and 3.3V power out), plus SPDIF output, your audio options are limitless. And yes, there’s a toggle to switch between SPDIF and i2S outputs—choose your destiny.
- **Headphone Jack Flexibility:** Whether you’re inputting or outputting, the 3.5mm headphone jack has you covered.
- **Cmoy Amp Included:** Dive into the classic 'Cmoy' style headphone amplifier, with the freedom to swap in your choice of 8pin DIP package op-amps.
- **Buffer Up:** Opt for an additional stage of amplification with the optional SOP8 package buffer—a true audiophile’s delight.
- **Control Your Sound:** Whether you prefer the tactile response of an analog potentiometer or the precision of a digital one (courtesy of the ATtiny1614), it’s all here.
- **Visualize Your Audio:** The VU Meter/ADC sampling feature, powered by another ATtiny1614, turns your audio into a visual symphony of LEDs.

And that's just the beginning. The ATtiny1614s are the heart and soul of this board, not just once but twice, with programming pins laid bare for all your hacking desires. The first chip lights up 8 LEDs based on pre-amp outputs for a customizable VU meter experience. The second? It’s the brain behind the digital potentiometers, with PORTB exposed for your tinkering pleasure—imagine adjusting volume via remote control or automating it based on environmental cues.

This board isn’t just a tool; it’s a playground for the audio tinkerer’s soul, designed to spark joy, innovation, and maybe a little bit of audio magic. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, the Audio Swiss Army Knife is ready to transform your audio experiments into experiences. Let the symphony begin!
